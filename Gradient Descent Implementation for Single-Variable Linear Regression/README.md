# 🧮 My First Machine Learning Project — Univariate Linear Regression

This little project means a lot to me. It's the **first time I ever implemented a machine learning model** on my own — no libraries, no shortcuts, just NumPy, some plotting, and what I could remember from math class.

What made it especially fun was realizing how much of what I learned in **multivariable calculus** actually shows up here — gradients, partial derivatives, optimization. These concepts always felt kind of abstract in class, but building this model helped me see how they come together in a real, tangible way.

Watching the cost function decrease, seeing the regression line form, and knowing that *I* made it all work — it was incredibly satisfying. I didn’t build anything fancy, but I **really enjoyed** every part of the process.

This was just a small personal project, but it made me more confident in exploring the world of machine learning. I'm excited to keep going.

☀️ Today’s little joy: treated myself to KOI’s boba tea — my favorite
